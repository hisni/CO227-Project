# CO227-Project
A web based application for Solid waste management. The application should be able to make easy communication between the general public and the buyers who buy solid waste (i: e a portal where general public and solid waste buyers interacts efficiently). State health inspectors should be able to monitor the waste disposal mechanism between public and the buyers.
